# MySocialApp
## Tech Stack: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS and Javascript,sqlite3, bootstrap

## This application allows the user to post as you would in a social media application. The database will will save the unique ID of the user along with the username and post detials.

###TODO: A few features I would like to add to this application would be: 
- creating a user login/logout page. This will store posts per user
- allow the user to follow other users and comments on posts 
- allo the user to view posts by certian users
- share posts on other social media platforms
- add the functionality of a twilio api to allow the user to share posts via sms

This application was created in a virtual environment.
